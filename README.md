Repaper is a word processing website aimed to **prevent AI cheating** in writing

## Potential Ideas

- **Highlighting** in multiple colors
- A few **different fonts** for different styles
- **Drawing functionality** so you can use mouse/trackpad to draw
- **French** language support
- **App version**
- Easy to work/**intuitive**
- **No Crashes**
- **List of files**
- Way to check if person is working
- File value is encrypted

### Encryption

File could be encrypted with a key received from a custom route (pb_hooks)

### Browser extension (maybe)

Could write down what websites user visits while turned on. Maybe the file could only be editable is the extension is turned on.
List of websites that are verified and if only those websites is visited, file could have a verified stamp
List of websites that are not allowed, and if one of those websites is visited, file could have a cheater stamp

List could be persistent, or could be saved to db and accessed with a code.

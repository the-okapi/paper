## Ideas (maybe)

- use **custom keypress events** to prevent copy and paste
- Have **assignment system** like teams for teachers
- Multiple people can view a file, but **only one can edit**, who has possession
- File can only be deleted if person who created the file and person who has possession **both agree to delete** it. (They can be the same person)
- **Highlighting** in multiple colors
- **underline**
- **Bold** formatting
- A few **different fonts** for different styles
- **Light and dark** mode
- Have **teacher accounts** who can see when **students account** last changed a file to **check if theyâ€™re working**
- Each person who changes a file has a **different color** writing.
- **Drawing functionality** so you can use mouse/trackpad to draw
- **French** language support
- **Inspector disabled**
- **App version**
- **Simple but modern ui**. Not to complicated or colorful or unrealistic. Potentially default shadcn-svelte
- Easy to work/**intuitive**
- Transfer to **word document**
- **No Crashes**
